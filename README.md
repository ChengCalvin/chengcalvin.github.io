# Design

For this website, I have used <b><i>React.js</i></b> as the framework for the frontend with <b><i>Material-UI</i></b> and <b><i>Styled Components</i></b> for styling the components. I used <b><i>Emailjs</i></b> to connect the contact form to my email directly and <b><i>Google ReCaptcha</i></b> to reduce potential spams from bots.

With <b><i>Material-UI</i></b> I have added the animation API and included a visibility tracker on the components to render only when the components are shown in the viewport.

The focus of this project was put on getting familiar with Styled Components with Material-UI and the ability to overwrite Material-UI behavior.
